"""The link between this agent and the index.

Claude Code opens every MCP connection once, when its process starts. It never
retries. A container that starts later answers on its port and stays invisible to the
agent for the whole session. `harness/rag.py` measures the SERVER. This module
measures the LINK, and the two are not the same reading.

Measured on 2026-09-05: the agent started at 13:48:48 and the `rag` container at
16:51:11. The container answered every HTTP probe, the canary printed `warnings`, and
the agent held no search tool for the whole session. Design law 3: a path that still
exists does not prove that the path is correct.

A time that this module cannot read stays `unknown`, and the brief prints nothing.
A default value must never look like a measurement (law 7).
